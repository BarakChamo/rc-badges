# [Recurse Center Tags](http://swag.recurse.com)

Ribbons and badges for open source project made at RC.

### How to use the tags

#### Method 1: Code Snippets

Go to the [tags project page](http://swag.recurse.com) and select a tag you want to embed in your page. Click `Copy to Clipboard` and the a snippet will be copied. The snippet includes all needed HTML, CSS and the logo SVG so it can display properly online or offline without any added resources.

#### Method 2: Compoments

The tags will soon be available as components for React and Angular 1 & 2 (a bit later on).

To install the tags module:
`npm install rc-badges`


### How to build and contribute

To build the tags run the webpack build command from the project's root folder: `webpack -w`.
Webpack will watch the project files and re-compile on every change. Note that this is not the webpack-dev-server 
so to open the project simply run `index.html` in your browser.
